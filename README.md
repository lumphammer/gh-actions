Reusable actions and workflows for Github Actions

## Why

Ideally these would live in a [shared-fvtt-bits](https://github.com/n3dst4/shared-fvtt-bits) but because you can only reference reusable workflows from the `.github/workflows` folder of the same repo, OR from a public repo, it's hard to make changes on a branch and test they're right. Hence this repo, so I can make CI changes here that affect work being done on feature branches of other repos.
